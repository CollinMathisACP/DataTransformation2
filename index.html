A6
var penguinPic=function(penguin)
{
    var pic = penguin.picture;
    var picObject = {picture: pic};
    return picObject;
};
This code works by retrieving the penguin's picture, and creating an object with that picture as an attribute; 
A7
var picAndQuiz=function(penguin)
{
    var pic = penguin.picture;
    var mean = d3.mean(penguin.quizes, getGrade);
    var picObject = {picture: pic,
                     quizMean: mean};
    return picObject;
};
This works the same as A6, but also retrieves the penguin's quizzes and averages them, storing the result in another attribute. 
A8
var listOfPicsAndQuiz= classroom.map(picAndQuiz);
This maps classroom into an array of objects created by A7. 
A9
var getPenguinObject=function(penguin)
{
    var pic = penguin.picture;
    var Qmean = d3.mean(penguin.quizes, getGrade);
    var Tmean = d3.mean(penguin.test, getGrade);
    var HWmean = d3.mean(penguin.homework, getGrade);
    var picObject = {picture: pic,
                     meanQuiz: Qmean,
                     meanTests: Tmean,
                     meanHW: HWmean,
                     finalGrade: penguin.final[0].grade
                    };
    return picObject;
};
This builds on A7 by also finding the average test and homework scores, and storing the results in seperate attributes. 
A10
var allObjects= classroom.map(getPenguinObject)
This maps classroom into an array of objects created by A9. 
B1
 var initialFunction = function(penguin)
        {
            var pic = penguin.picture;
            var finalGrade = penguin.final[0].grade;
            var result = {picture: pic,
                            final: finalGrade        };
            return result;
        };
     
   var picAndFinal = function(classroom)
   {
       return classroom.map(initialFunction);
   }
This defines a method that takes a penguin and returns an object that has its picture and final grade as attributes. Then, clasroom is mapped using that function. 
C1
var initialFunction = function(penguin)
{
     return penguin.quizes[0].grade;            
};
    
var quizAverage = function(classroom)
{
    return d3.mean(classroom.map(initialFunction));
}
This defines a function that retrieves the first quiz grade of a given penguin. Then, classroom is mapped into an array of numbers using that method, and the average of that array is returned. 
D1
var givenDayAverages= function(day, classroom)
{
    var penguinToQuizes = function(penguin)
    {
        return penguin.quizes;
    }
    
    var quizes = classroom.map(penguinToQuizes);
    
    var quizesToSingleQuiz = function(quizes)
    {
        return quizes[day].grade;
    }
    
    var quizFromDay = quizes.map(quizesToSingleQuiz);
    
    return d3.mean(quizFromDay);
    
}
This function defines a method that retrieves a penguin's quizes. Then, classroom is mapped into an array of arrays of quizes using that method. Next, a method is defined that retrieves a quiz grade of a given day from an array of quizes. Then, quizes is mapped using that method, resulting in an array of numbers. The mean is then taken and returned.
